This updated react app directly mirrors my figma design for my CourtCrew website. In this case, the react portions shows the view profiles portion of the website. In the app, there are 3 main components under the overarching App. The first is the NavBar component which holds the entire Navigation bar including the CourtCrew Title and other page Titles. The second component is the Footer which contains our other social media as well as other text like my name. The last component I have made is the profile card component which is used as the base template for all the users profile cards. It contains props for the profile picture, first name, last name, preferred sport, as well as biography. Additionally I have implemented a like button in the form of a star as my useState example. When a user clicks the star on one of the profiles it will change colors indicating you have favorited that profile. As my useEffect example, I have implemented a count that console logs a count evertime the state any of the like buttons are changed.
